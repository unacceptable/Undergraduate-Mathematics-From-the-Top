# Undergraduate Mathematics: From the Top

A comprehensive, approachable mathematics textbook designed for non-traditional students—returning learners, working adults balancing school with jobs and families, and anyone wanting a fresh start with math.

## About This Project

This textbook aims to cover the essential undergraduate mathematics curriculum in an accessible way:

- **Calculus I–III**
- **Statistics**
- **Statics**
- **Discrete Mathematics**
- **Differential Equations**
- **Linear Algebra**

## Current Status

**Calculus I** — In Progress

## Target Audience

This book is written specifically for non-traditional students:

- Returning learners coming back to education after time away
- Working adults balancing school with jobs and family responsibilities
- Anyone who wants a fresh, approachable start with mathematics

## History

The first section of this book was originally created as a math final during my senior year of high school in 2009. The original assignment was supposed to be 4-5 pages, but mine exceeded 20 pages. That work is now being adapted into the first section of this book.

Special thanks to Mr. Kevin Meredith for being an awesome high school math teacher and for giving me a few extra days to complete the original work.
